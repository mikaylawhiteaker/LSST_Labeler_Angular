      How to Classify
    </h4>
    <p>
        We are looking at asteroids from all over the sky. Sometimes the patch of sky will be crowded with background stars that might make it harder to identify whether the asteroid has a coma/tail as well as make it hard to identify which source in the image is the asteroid. We want to know about that. Look at the asteroid image (large image on left with purple crosshairs). If you see more than one source in the central region bordered by the crosshairs, answer 'yes'. Compare the center region to the examples below.
